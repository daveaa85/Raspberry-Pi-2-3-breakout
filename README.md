This is an Eagle CAD project. It breaks out the 40 pin Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 io connector to a set of 3 rows of header pins.

It was created to make it easier to wire up and monitor pins. The way I use it is to populate the board with 2 rows of headers. The last set of holes are left open. That way DMM probes have a hole to drop into, and not slip off the target signal.
